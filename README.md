# Eventfull

  ## Description
  Eventfull strives on making event experiences more full by creating a networking platform for event-goers. Whether it be for a concert or convention, Eventfull offers users the ability to connect pre-event in order to optimize their experiences during them. By finding and adding events they are interested in to the site-wide social feed, users can interact with one another and gain new perspectives on events they may not have had prior.

The motivation behind Eventfull comes from the dreaded planning stage before attending any event: I don't want to go alone but who will I go with? Where are the best seats in the venue for the best view of the stage? What can I expect to get out of an event like this? Many questions like these often remain unanswered up until an event itself, but Eventfull aims to diminish these concerns by creating a platform where event-goers can communicate on event posts they see from other event-goers. Users can explore through SeatGeek's catalog of ticketed events and share event posts containing their preferences, where other users will then be able to comment and interact. Users can discuss a variety of topics on any event post, whether it be asking/receiving advice or creating a group to go with.

## Features <a name ='features'></a>
- Browse through an extensive catalog of ticketed events from SeatGeek API

## Usage <a name ='usage'></a>
Eventfull can be accessed via Heroku at [this link](). When first visiting Eventfull, new users can browse through the Explore or Social pages to search through SeatGeek events or see what site users have posted, however access to saving events and interacting with other users is restricted until logging in/signing up.    
    
Once logged in, users will have access to their user profile where they can add events they find from the Explore page. On the Explore page, users can search for any events they are interested in by typing in the name of the event or the performer (if a concert). If there is preference for searching by a location instead, the user can type in the city where they would like to attend the event. Once a user finds an event they are interested in, they can either add the event to their profile or find tickets for the event (where they will be redirected to the SeatGeek ticketing site for that particular event). If an event is added, the user will be redirected to their profile where they can fill out their preferences (No preference, Want a Group or Want to go Solo) and status (Interested, Going, Not Going) regarding the event; these are shown on the event's dedicated post on the Social feed of the site.   
    
The Social page is populated based on what events Eventfull users have added to their profiles most recently, with the top-left most event being the most recently added event. Users can either browse through this recent feed or find a particular user's events by searching in the search bar. Each event on the Social page has its own discussion aspect where users can toggle posts and discuss with other users within that event post. From here, users can either ask for or offer advice/comments they have and correspond with other users.
